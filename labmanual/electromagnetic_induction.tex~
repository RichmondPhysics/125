\textbf{Objectives}

To investigate:

\begin{itemize}
\item The effect of changing magnetic fields on induced emf and current.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Introduction} 

%A charged object moving through a magnetic field experiences a force
%which is proportional to the magnitude of its charge and to its speed
%perpendicular to the field: $F = qvB_\perp$. 
If the magnetic flux through a coil of wire changes, an emf (or voltage) 
will be induced in the coil. This is Faraday's Law. If the coil of wire 
forms a closed loop, then a current will be induced in the wire. The direction 
of this current is such that the magnetic field it produces opposes the change 
in the external field. This is known as Lenz's Law. Similarly, varying the 
current in one coil (the primary) produces a current in another nearby coil 
(the secondary) due to the varying magnetic field produced by the first coil. 
The current in the second coil, too, will flow in a direction that creates a 
magnetic field which opposes the change in the field of the first coil (again, 
due to Lenz's Law). 
These relationships between changing fields and currents are known 
collectively as electromagnetic induction.

\textbf{Apparatus} 

\begin{itemize}
\item one small wire coil
\item voltage sensor
\item two alligator clips
\item bar magnet
\item Pasco 750 Interface
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Activity 1: A Moving Magnet and a Coil}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Connect the coil to the voltage sensor using the alligator clips. Connect the voltage sensor to port A on the Pasco 750 interface.
\item Turn on the computer and launch {\it EM Induction} in the $132 Workshop$ 
under $Physics Applications$ in the {\bf Start, Programs} menu.

\item Place a bar magnet vertically along the axis of the small coil with
the N-pole touching the coil.

\item Start recording data and lift the bar magnet quickly straight up.

\item At the end of the data taking interval, the computer should display
a value for the electromotive force (emf) induced in the small coil.
Several trials may be required to get the correct timing between starting
the data acquisition and removing the magnet. Note and record the sign of the 
induced emf.\vspace{10mm}

\item \textbf{Prediction}: If you lower the magnet, N-pole down, quickly
toward the coil, what will be the sign of the emf? \vspace{15mm}

\item Carry out the experiment, starting the data acquisition, then lowering the magnet.
Record the sign of the induced emf.\vspace{10mm}

\item Did your result confirm or refute your prediction?\vspace{20mm}

\item \textbf{Prediction}: What will happen to the emf if you perform the
same pair of experiments with the S-pole toward the coil? \vspace{20mm}

\item Perform the two experiments, lifting and lowering the magnet, with
the S-pole down. Record the sign of the induced emf in each case.\vspace{20mm}

\item How did the results compare with your predictions?

\end{enumerate}
